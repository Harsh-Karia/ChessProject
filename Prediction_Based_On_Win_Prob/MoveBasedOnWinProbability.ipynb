        "# Attempt: Predicting moves based on Win probability\n",
        "\n",
        "##### We attempted to create a model that would predict a move based on win probability of higher than 0.5. Essentially, we trained the model on moves that were generally associated with a final game outcome of winning.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### The input to the model is an 8x8 chess board, with white pieces encoded in 6 channels, and black pieces encoded in another 6 channels, because there are 6 different types of pieces: pawns, knights, bishops, rooks, queens, and kings. So we have a 12 x 8 x 8 tensor as our input to the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### The output of the model is a 64 x 64 tensor that is the move prediction. The rows represent the start square, of which there are 64 possibilities, and the columns represent the end square, of which there are 64 possibilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Similar to the other win probability model, we used a Convolutional Neural Network architecture. By contrast, this model uses win probability to predict the best move.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### This ended up not working, with it making up illegal moves."
